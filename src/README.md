# Source layout

One Kotlin Multiplatform code base produces both published artifacts (npm
`@equisoft/tax-ca`, Maven `com.equisoft:tax-ca`).

| Source set | Role |
|---|---|
| `commonMain` | **The single source of truth** — all tax data and calculation logic, idiomatic Kotlin (camelCase data classes, `Double` numbers, `kotlinx-datetime` dates). Compiles to both targets. |
| `commonTest` | The test suite (ported from the legacy jest specs, 1:1). Runs on **both** JVM and Node — platform math drift fails the build. |
| `jsMain` | The npm compatibility facade: re-exposes everything with the legacy TypeScript package's exact names, shapes, and runtime semantics. See [jsMain/README.md](jsMain/README.md). |
| `jvmMain` | The JVM boundary layer: `BigDecimal` views and `java.time` overloads for services like financial-api. See [jvmMain/README.md](jvmMain/README.md). |
| `jvmTest` | JVM-only tests (BigDecimal views, java.time overloads, BigDecimal-exact variants). |

## Conventions in commonMain

- **Numbers are `Double`** (`Int` for years/ages/counts). This is a deliberate decision,
  not an oversight — see [jvmMain/README.md](jvmMain/README.md) for the numeric policy.
- **Dates are `kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate`.** No wall-clock access in common code:
  functions that need "today" take it as a parameter (the JS facade supplies `now()`).
- **Never use `kotlin.math.round`** — JS `Math.round` rounds ties toward +Infinity;
  use `utils.roundToPrecision` (implemented as `floor(x + 0.5)`, JS-faithful).
- Every data file keeps its `Sources` / `Revised` header comment — that is the audit
  trail for where values come from and when they were last checked.
- Some legacy quirks are preserved deliberately and commented in place (e.g. CPP rounds
  its average indexation rate to 3 digits but QPP to 2; JS `setUTCFullYear` overflows
  Feb 29 to Mar 1). Do not "fix" them without a ruling — numeric output is contractual.

## Yearly data revision workflow

1. Update the values in the relevant `commonMain` data file(s); refresh the
   `Sources` / `Revised` header.
2. Update the affected expectations in `commonTest`.
3. `./gradlew build` — all targets compile, tests pass on JVM and Node.
4. `yarn build && yarn compat` — assemble the npm package and check that its TypeScript
   declarations still support the consumer import surface. This check is independent
   of tax values. Behavior and updated data expectations are covered by `commonTest`
   on JVM and Node. See [../ts-compat/README.md](../ts-compat/README.md).
5. One release ships the new data to npm and Maven simultaneously (same version).
